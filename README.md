## 🌟 Key Features & Workflows

### 1. 👥 Dual Role-Based Portals

- **Villager Portal**:
  - Secure registration and login with Indian mobile number validation (`+91` / 10 digits) and strict password rules.
  - Personalized Dashboard with summary counters (Total, Pending, In Progress, Resolved).
  - Multi-step complaint submission with camera capture, GPS geolocation tagging, and category selection.
  - Visual 4-stage complaint resolution progress tracker (`Submitted` ➔ `Acknowledged` ➔ `In Progress` ➔ `Resolved`).
  - In-app notification center with real-time alerts.

- **Panchayat Admin Portal**:
  - Secure official login for Sarpanch, Panchayat Secretary, and Ward Engineers.
  - Triage management table automatically sorted: **HIGH Priority first, then MEDIUM, then LOW. Within each priority, oldest unresolved requests first.**
  - One-click **"Acknowledged"** workflow: logs timestamp, official name, audit trail, and notifies the villager.
  - **"Work Done"** completion workflow: confirmation modal with resolution notes and automated citizen notification.
  - Official priority override with recorded audit justification.
  - Comprehensive reports and analytics dashboard with resolution metrics.

### 2. ⚡ AI-Based Priority Classification

Every reported problem automatically receives one of three priority levels (**HIGH**, **MEDIUM**, **LOW**) along with a concise justification:

- **HIGH Priority**:
  - Exposed live electrical wiring or sparking transformers.
  - Severe drinking water contamination or sewage flooding into homes.
  - Collapsed roads, major cave-ins, or fatal public transit hazards.
  - Imminent structural collapse threats or public animal hazards.
- **MEDIUM Priority**:
  - Non-working streetlights in busy areas or nocturnal security risks.
  - Water pipeline leaks and supply disruptions without immediate toxic contamination.
  - Significant potholes and road wear.
  - Overflowing municipal garbage bins and blocked drains.
- **LOW Priority**:
  - Minor cosmetic repairs (faded paint, park bench aesthetics).
  - Non-hazardous routine maintenance and beautification suggestions.

*Dual Engine*: Integrated with Gemini AI (`VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`) with an automatic, resilient contextual heuristic rule-based fallback.
